I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mistake in the file path you provided. The "migrations" directory typically doesn't contain a "views.py" file. It's usually found in the main app directory. 

However, if you meant "decentralized_ai_platform/ai_assistant/views.py", here's a basic example of what the code in that file might look like:


from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import AIAssistant

def index(request):
    all_assistants = AIAssistant.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'ai_assistant/index.html', {'all_assistants': all_assistants})

def detail(request, assistant_id):
    assistant = AIAssistant.objects.get(pk=assistant_id)
    return render(request, 'ai_assistant/detail.html', {'assistant': assistant})


This code defines two views: "index" and "detail". The "index" view retrieves all AI assistants from the database and passes them to the 'ai_assistant/index.html' template. The "detail" view retrieves a specific AI assistant by its ID and passes it to the 'ai_assistant/detail.html' template.
