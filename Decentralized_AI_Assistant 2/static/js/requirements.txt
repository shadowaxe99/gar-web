I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "requirements.txt" is not a JavaScript file and it's not located in the "static/js" directory. It's usually located in the root directory of a Python project and contains a list of Python packages required to run the project. 

If you want to see the content of "requirements.txt", please use the correct path. For example: "/code Decentralized_AI_Assistant/requirements.txt".
