I'm sorry, but the file you're asking for, "db.sqlite3", is a SQLite database file, not a code file. It doesn't contain human-readable code that can be displayed or edited. It contains binary data managed by SQLite. If you need to interact with the data, you would use SQL commands via a SQLite client or library.
